You are an expert technical writer and dashboard documentation evaluator.

Evaluate the following Markdown documentation:
---

---

Metadata used to generate the documentation:
---
{metadata}
---

Evaluate it against the following criteria:
1. Does it include all necessary sections: Overview, Purpose, Business Questions, Audience, Data Sources?
2. Are the explanations clear, free of jargon, and business-friendly?
3. Are there any hallucinated facts or incorrect metrics/definitions?
4. Are examples or visuals mentioned when appropriate?
5. Are known assumptions or limitations present?

If any of these are missing or poorly written, regenerate a corrected version. Output the improved Markdown only, without commentary.

Make the documentation as detailed as possible.
Use clear, simple language suitable for business users, analysts, and stakeholders.
Use visuals representations when needed.
